# week 6

Our group had a discussion to confirm the research background and find out our innovation points for designing products. Then we budgeted the funds for the products we designed, determined the deliverables and the verification plan.

**Motivation:**

The motivation for this project arises from the increasing demand for versatile amphibious robots in industrial settings. However, current options on the market have significant shortcomings.

**Context:**

The primary aim of our project is to address the inadequacies of current amphibious robots available in the market and to engineer an innovative solution that is efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain.

**Background:**

Presently, there is a wealth of research on amphibious robots, yet only a scant few of these innovations have transitioned into industrialized production and practical applications. Notably, our research indicates that the majority of current underwater robots are concentrated in duck-bill and crawler-type designs, with propeller-driven mechanisms being relatively rare. This finding underscores the innovative nature of our project.

**Validation Plan.**

**Deliverable 1: Physical Working Prototype**

**Criteria to be Measured:**

**Traction and Stability:** We will measure the robot's ability to navigate slippery environments, such as swamps and wetlands, by quantifying the traction it generates on different surfaces.
**Obstacle Avoidance:** The effectiveness of the autopilot system in recognizing obstacles and autonomously planning a path will be evaluated. We will measure the robot's ability to avoid obstacles of various sizes and shapes.

**Validation Method:**

For traction and stability, we will conduct physical tests on different terrains, recording data on the robot's movement and stability. Obstacle avoidance will be tested using a controlled obstacle course where the robot's performance in identifying and avoiding obstacles will be quantified.

**Deliverable 2: Conceptual Design with Simulation Verification**

**Criteria to be Measured:**

**Performance Predictions vs. Actual Performance:** We will compare the predicted performance of the twin-screw mechanism, autopilot system, and energy management against actual performance data.
**Energy Efficiency:** The energy consumption of the robot will be measured and compared to the energy-saving modes proposed in the design.

**Validation Method:**

Performance predictions will be verified through simulation and experimentation. We will collect data on the robot's movement, obstacle avoidance, and energy consumption and compare it to the design specifications.

**Deliverable 3: Feasibility Study**

**Criteria to be Measured:**

**Technical Viability:** The feasibility study will be evaluated based on whether it successfully assesses the technical viability of deploying the robot in swamps and wetlands.
Economic and Practical Feasibility: We will assess the economic and practical aspects outlined in the study, including estimated costs, maintenance requirements, and potential applications.

**Validation Method:**

Technical viability will be evaluated by expert review and assessment of the study's methodology and findings. The economic and practical feasibility will be measured by comparing the study's estimates with real-world data and industry standards.

**Deliverable 4: Schematics of Design Components and Assembly**

**Criteria to be Measured:**

**Comprehensiveness and Clarity:** We will evaluate the schematics based on their ability to comprehensively represent all design components and assembly steps and their clarity in conveying this information.

**Validation Method:**

A team of experts in mechanical engineering will conduct a comprehensive review of the schematics. They will assess whether the schematics provide a clear and complete guide for replicating the robot's design.

**Deliverable 5: Battery Energy Management System**

**Criteria to be Measured:**

**Energy Efficiency:** We will measure the energy efficiency of the battery management system, comparing the actual performance of the batteries against the proposed high-efficiency and long-life specifications.

**Validation Method:**

Data on the actual energy consumption and battery performance will be collected and compared to the design specifications.
In all cases, the validation procedures will be quantifiable, verifiable, and reproducible. The results of these measurements will be concise and well-defined, addressing the technical aspects and needs of the project. These validations aim to ensure that our deliverables align with the project's objectives, and the data collected will support the broad spectrum of client and stakeholder concerns.
For projects with external clients, we will provide a written evaluation of both the deliverables and our team's work to the instructor.
